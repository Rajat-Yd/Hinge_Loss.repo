# Hinge_Loss.repo
A simple Type of Loss Function in Perceptron To find out best possible Classifier.
# What is Loss Function ? :
- It's a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset.
- The loss function for the perceptron is given as: Lp(x, y,w) = max(0,âˆ’ywT x).
# Hinge Loss :
- It is used to find a linear decision boundary that can separate two classes of data.
- The perceptron algorithm uses a loss function called the "hinge loss" function.
- The hinge loss function is a type of margin loss function that penalizes misclassifications.
- It measures the distance between the predi
